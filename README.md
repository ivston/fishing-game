**Fishing with Annie by Ivan STOYANOV**

**Why I choose this game?**

For my first project at Ironhack, I chose to create this simple game inspired by a favorite of mine I used to play when I was little. 
My idea was to have a very stripped down look and game logic in order to really focus on applying what we learned over the past 3 weeks without driving myself crazy. 

**Key features**

* Hit collision: When the fishing hook catches a scooter
* Generating 10 scooters at random positions in the water

**What's next?**

* Adding a soundscape
* Upgrading the visual identity, better background, animated water, more detailed character
* Adding more elements in the water: things to avoid, bonus items etc.
* Eliminating small bugs (flashing scooter)

* Try it out!
